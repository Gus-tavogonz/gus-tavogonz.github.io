This is my portfolio website. The idea was to showcase the differente projects I've been part of, and to present them in a way that's easy to navigate.

Some of the techonologies I used were:

Filterizr: http://yiotis.net/filterizr/
This allowed me to classify each category and have them reorder or dissapear

Chocolat: http://chocolat.insipi.de/#demo
Chocolat is the best lightbox I found, is easy to use and customizable.

Animate on Scroll: https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/
To create transitions, fade-ins and fade-outs on scroll

HTML, JavaScript and CSS

Appreciate any advice or input.

Thank you!
